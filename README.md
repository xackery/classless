# Classless FAQ


## Introduction

EQ Classless 3.0 Frequently Asked Questions + System/Mechanics Explanations


- Class / Classless System
   - Classed vs Classless player characters
      - All characters start with a class from normal Everquest, and convert to ‘classless’ at any time by talking to the NPC name ‘CHAOS’ found in ‘Loading’ zone. 
      - Switching a character to Classless is a permanent decision and is not reversible. 
      - Characters who retain their original Everquest class are referred to as Classed Characters, and characters who have converted to Classless are referred to as Classless Characters. 
         - Many systems and mechanics work differently for Classed and Classless characters, so it's important to keep this naming distinction in mind.
   - What is the difference?
      - Classed Characters 
         - Operate like they would in normal Everquest. 
         - Gear, Spells, Abilities are Limited to what the the characters Race and Class is able to learn / use / wear
         - Spells and Skills are automatically learned as level
         - Synergy Bonus is always at 100%!
      - Classless Characters
         - Can learn and use any spell / ability / gear they can find
         - Spells and Skills must be found
         - Synergy Bonus starts at 0%, but can be raised to 100%
         - Can complete any quest and use the resulting equipment (like epics)
   - Why would I choose one over the other?
      - Classed Characters
         - Predictable spells and abilities as you level.
         - Full Synergy bonus without any effort
         - Innate skills and spells and class specific spells/abilities that you can carry over when you switch to Classless
            - See Skills section for list of innate skills and further explanation
         - Can get specific spells before you switch to Classless
      - Classless Characters
         - Access to all spells and abilities opening up tons of possibilities, but subject to drop RNG for access to said spells and abilities
         - Wear any and all equipment
   - Design intentions and ‘why were classes included in the game at all’?
      - Classed characters were added to the game to
         - Lower the barrier for entry / learning curve for new players. Having Classed characters allows for some familiarity when starting on the server, rather than being thrown straight into the Classless deep end.
         - Starting Classed allows players to target some specific spells early, helping to reduce the chance that players don't get decent spell drops for a long time.
   - Racial Bonuses?
      - All Racial bonuses have been removed.
      - It's possible we will get custom Racial bonuses in the future, but that is uncertain
      - [FACTION NORMALIZATION]?
- Synergy
   - What is it?
      - Synergy is a new custom mechanic that rewards using similar spells and abilities. Synergy Bonus is per-Skill / Spell  and improves damage and healing output of the Skill / Spell by 0 to 100%.
   - How does it calculate / work?
      - For each Skill / Spell you have on your spell bar, the server calculates its Synergy Bonus. This Bonus is based on how many similar Skills / Spell you have on your spell bar. Similarity is calculated using multiple categories, allowing you to create complex combinations of Skills / Spells and maximize their Synergy Bonus.
   - What are the categories that generate bonuses?
      - Spells that share these categories will generate Synergy Bonus with each other
         - Class
            - Original EQ Class that gets the spell
               - ie: Enchanter spells
         - Archetype
            - Original EQ Class group (Archetype) that gets the spell
               - ie: Healer spells
         - Spell Effect
            - The Effect Type of the spell
               - ie: Damage Over Time spells (DOTs)
   - How do I know how much I have?
      - Each Ability / Spell on your spell bar will show its current Synergy Bonus on the individual spell gem on your spell bar. 
      - This readout is the only place you will see your Synergy Bonus
      - The Synergy Bonus readout is updated in real time, and calculated server side.
   - How much do I need to cap it?
      - 100% is the Synergy Bonus cap per spell
      - How your full array of Abilities and Spells interact will be very subjective and reach 100% Synergy Bonus will require you to experiment with different spell combinations.
   - What are the best spell combos?
      - There is no best setup. The Synergy system allows you to get bonuses as you customize your character to match your playstyle. 
   - Does it work for all spells?
      - Synergy Bonus is only added to Damage and Healing output of Abilities and Spells, so ones that don't do damage or healing will not benefit from Synergy
         - Abilities and Spells that don't directly benefit from Synergy Bonus, still contribute to the Synergy Bonus calculation for other Abilities and Spells. 
   - Do I need to worry about it?
      - No, but yes. While interacting with the Synergy system is not required to play on Classless 3.0, 100% bonus to Damage and Healing is very very nice!
   - Synergy Example setups, with tables showing each spell on the bar, what categories they hit, and estimated synergy bonus per category w/ total estimated Synergy bonus per spell
      - Gotta Write this once Synergy is live. I want to use real data.

	      - - Abilities, Skills, Spells and AutoScribe
   - Where do I get spells?
      - Classed Characters
         - Your character will unlock all their Abilities, Skills, and Spells as they level up.
         - Upon reaching a level where you would gain an Ability, Skill, or Spell, your character will automatically learn any and all that you would get and it is added to your spell book.
         - Most spells are granted at the level the class would get them in Everquest. Check Project 1999 Wiki for a mostly accurate list of spells and their levels.
      - Classless Characters
         - All Abilities, Skills, and Spells are dropped by monsters.
         - When an Ability, Skill, or Spell drops for you, it will automatically be learned and added to your spell book.
   - What about abilities?
      - All usable Skills and Abilities are now ‘spells’ that will appear in your spell book
      - You can only use Skills, Abilities, or Spells that you have put on your spell bar
   - How can I get a specific spell?
      - Classed Characters
         - Level up until you unlock the spell
      - Classless Characters
         - Farm lots of monsters that are high enough level to drop the spell you want
         - Craft the spell using the Spell Runes and Crafting system
   - Spell level ranges / dropping mechanic
      - Every monster a Classless character kills has a chance to drop a spell
         - Monsters who drop a spell, drop a spell randomly selected from all available spells for all classes between level 0 and the level of the monster.
            - Killing higher level monsters gives you a chance to receive higher level spells, but the pool of available spells is rather large
            - Killing low level monsters gives you a chance to get a spell from a much smaller pool of available spells, but the spells are lower level
            - For spells that multiple classes would get, assume that the lowest level that a class would unlock that spell is the level target for a monster to drop that spell.
               - ie: Spirit of Wolf can normally be obtained by Beastlords, Druids, Shamans, and Rangers. Shamans get the spell at level 9, while the other classes get it at later levels. So any monster higher than level 9 has the ability to drop Spirit of Wolf.
   - Duplicate spells → Runes?
   - Class skills
      - Skills like Lay on Hands and Harmtouch are availed to the Classed characters who would normally get them as well as to Classless characters as drops
   - Innate skills
      - Some Classed Characters will get some skills Innately. These Innate skills do not require a slot on your spell bar to be active
         - Druid and Ranger will get innate Track skill that will improve as they level
      - Innate skills will be carried over if/when a character who possesses them switches to Classless.
         - When switching to Classless, Innate skills become active skills, and will be added to the now Classless characters spell book.
         - Carried over Innate skills will need to be put on the spell bar for them to be active once the Character has switched to Classless
   - What happens to my Abilities / Skills / Spells when I switch to Classless?
      - When any Classed Character switches to Classless, they will be able to keep all the Abilities / Skills / Spells that they have on their spell bar at the time of the switch. They will NOT keep the Abilities / Skills / Spells that are not currently on their spell bar.
         - This is not reversible, re-doable, or in any way modifiable after the fact. Be sure you have the set of spells you want to keep on  your spell bar when you switch to Classless.
      - Innate Skills do not need to be on the spell bar to be carried over to the Classless character
- Loot, AutoLoot, Individual Loot, and Loot Lockouts
   - What is AutoLoot
      - AutoLoot is a custom system on the Classless 3.0 server that allows some dropped items to be instantly teleported to a player's inventory. Think the Advanced Loot system from Live Everquest, but dumber and with way less user hassle.
      - What is needed to enable AutoLoot
         - Nothing, AutoLoot is always enabled
         - Possessing one of the special AutoLoot bags (in a characters top level inventory slot [not inside another bag]) enables that bag to AutoLoot the items its designed for
      - What kind of items AutoLoot
         - Partial stacks of items in any bag will autoloot until the stack is full!
         - It depends on the bag! Currently there are bags that will AutoLoot:
            - Stackable Items
            - Tradeskill Items
            - Spell Crafting Runes
         - Other bags may be added in the future
      - Can I set specific items to AutoLoot / customize the logic
         - Outside of adding partial stacks to your bags, there is no way to customize the AutoLoot logic. 
         - Special AutoLoot bags only AutoLoot the items that meet their logical qualifiers.
   - What is Individual Loot
      - Individual Loot is a custom system that allows each player in a group to receive loot from each monster. Any corpses or loot you can see if your’s!
      - The Individual Loot system spawns a corpse for each player who was in the group that killed the monster AND was on the monsters Hate List when the monster died.
         - Other players cannot see or interact with the corpse of monsters that is for you. No more Ninja looting!
         - Each corpse rolls from the monsters loot table individually. Your group mates will get different loot rolls than you, though you all will receive the same roll of the monster’s same loot table.
   - What are Loot Lockouts
      - Loot Lockout is a custom system for Classless 3.0 that ties characters to the death of certain monsters / encounters and limits the frequency that a single character can receive loot from that monster or encounter.
      - When a monster that has a Loot Lockout Timer is slain, and a corpse is generated for a character, the character is flagged with that monster’s Loot Lockout Timer and that character will not be able to receive loot from that monster until the timer expires
      - While flagged with a Loot Lockout Timer, a character can still kill the monster, but will not receive a corpse or loot.
      - Like Individual Loot, Loot Lockouts are individual!
         - If 4 players with a Loot Lockout Timer group with 2 players who do not have the Loot Lockout Timer, and the group slays the monster, only the 2 players without the Loot Lockout Timer will receive corpses and thus loot.
      - Loot Lockout Timers vary between monsters, bosses, and encounters. Some are very short, and some are rather long.
      - How do I know if I have a Loot Lockout Timer on a specific monster?
         - The Portal in ‘Loading’ zone offers an option to check your Loot Lockout Timers
         - Killing a monster that you have an existing Loot Lockout Timer for provides you with a message that indicates that you have an existing Loot Lockout timer for that monster.
      - Loot Lockout Timers are actually Account based, and not Character based. If you loot a monster on 1 character, you will not be able to loot it on another character until the Loot Lockout Timer has passed.
      - Design Intention
         - This system was designed to allow players to group with and/or help other players, while still limiting progression and loot to some degree. Its normal Lockouts, but for the corpses / loot and not time/access gates for redoing content.
- Augments and AutoUpgrade
   - What are Augments?
      - Classless uses Everquest’s Augment system in a unique way. Simply put, Augments are items that grant a single Main Stat that can be socketed into each piece of your gear thus increasing your Main Stat value and power level. 
   - Where do I get Augments?
      - Augments drop from every monster, though the Stat value of Augments varies based on the monster they drop from (among other things)
   - Can I trade or sell my Augments?
      - No. All Augments are now No Drop.
   - What is the best Augment?
      - That’s very subjective and depends on your playstyle and build.
   - How do I use Augments
      - To slot an Augment in an item you have, Right Click on the item and to open its information window, Left Click on the Aument to put it on your cursor, Left Click the Augment on to the empty black box representing the Augment slot on your items information window. The Aug should move from your cursor into the item window.
   - How do I remove/replace/reuse Augments?
      - You can remove Augments from items, but you will always either lose the item or lose the Augment in the process
         - If you want to keep your Augment, you will need to make a Hotkey for the Distill Augment AA found in the Archetype tab of your AA window (default key: V). With the item containing the Augment you want to save/reuse on your cursor, simply click or press the hotkey for Distill Augment. The item will disappear and the Augment will be on your cursor.
         - If you want to keep the item but remove the augment, Right Click on the item to open the item information window, then Right Click on the Augment in the items Augment slot and select Destroy from the drop down list. The Aug will be destroyed, and the Items Augment slot will be open for a new Augment.
   - The Item you put your Augments in does matter
      - Stats on an item multiply the effectiveness of Augments in that item if the Stat on the item and the Augment match
         - Example: Placing a 150 Strength Augment into a Breastplate that has 7 Strength among its natural stats would yield a Breastplate that provides 167.5 Strength
            - 150 - 1.07 = 160.5 ---The Augment’s stat value is multiplied by the items matching natural stat value as a percentage
            - 160.5 + 7 = 167.5 --- The Augment and Item’s final values are added 
   - What is AutoUpgrade
      - AutoUpgrade is a custom system that allows dropped Augments to automatically replace the lowest value Augment in your currently equipped gear that matches the dropped Augment’s Stat. This allows for automatic Augment progression as you level without any user involvement!
      - How do I enable AutoUpgrade for my Augments?
         - AutoUpgrade is always on. Simply have any Augment slotted into an equipped item and any higher value Augments of that Stat will replace your Augment automatically!
      - Why does this exist?
         - Previous iterations of the Classless server used Augments, but many players found storing, sorting, and changing Augments in their gear tedious. This system alleviates all of those woes and allows for smooth and simple upgrade of Augments as players play the game.
      - Why have Augments stopped dropping for me?
         - Once all of your equipment is full of Augments, any new Augment drops that do not get AutoUpgraded are automatically converted into a small amount of coin.
            - This was designed to minimize the amount of corpses that a player has to search through for items
            - This is always on and cannot be disabled
            - If you need non-upgrade Augments, say for a second gear set, equip an item with no Augment and new Augments will drop again.
      - Zero Stat Augments
         - The Portal in the ‘Loading’ zone will offer Zero Stat value Augments for sale.
         - Can be slotted into any Augment slot, enabling Augment AutoUpgrade without having to have found all of the Augments you want to use
- Equipment and you!
   - Does it matter what equipment I choose?
      - Yes! Aside from Augment bonuses from equipment with natural stats, some equipment modifies how your character functions drastically!
   - Visible slot equipment
      - What are the visible slot armors?
         - All items that are equippable into these equipment slots: Chest, Legs, Arms, Feet, Head, Hands, and both Wrists
      - Why are these special?
         -       - What is the difference between Cloth, Leather, Chain, and Plate?
         - Yes that's Damage in and out!
         - Examples
   - Non-Visible slot equipment
      - Not much here but stats and Augment slots
   - Shields
      - 30% Damage Reduction, similar to wearing full Visible slot Plate armor

   - How does Instance loot work?
   - Are there Instance Lockouts?
   - How do I ‘request’ an Instance?
   - How does XP work in Instances?
- Endurance and Mana
   - General changes
      - Mana is for healing only
      - Endurance is for offensive spells and abilities
   - Endurance
      - Yellow bar by HP (sometimes called Stamina, but its Endurance)
      - Current Endurance modifies damage / effectiveness of your offensive abilities. Higher endurance when you use your spell/ability = higher damage
      - Offensive Spell and Ability usage cost Endurance
      - All Mana Regen sources converted to Endurance Regen
      - Rests / Regens to 50% (meaning if you are at 0 it regens to 50%, and if you are at 100% is decays to 50%)
      - Invigor and Endurance/Stamina heals/regen spells work
   - Mana
      - Mana is now only for healing spells and abilities
      - Mana Regen is now non-existent. All Mana Regen items/spells/abilities have been converted to Endurance
      - Most heals costs Mana, though some heals do not cost any mana
      - Mana does not regenerate in combat, but will regenerate rather quickly out of combat
   - Why were these changes made?
      - Allows for modifying healing w/o breaking all spells. Also allows for 
- Custom NPC AI
   - Why is this trash monster wrecking my group!? WTF is this???
   - Which NPC’s have combat AI now?
      - All of them, including merchants, pets, bosses, and your pets
   - Can AI be disabled so I can  mindlessly grind mobs while doing something else? 
      - Nope, game is kind of hard now.
   - 3 Tiers of NPC AI
      - ‘Bag o Hammers’ AI - Default AI for all monsters. They will use their class abilities against you, but they aren't too smart. Still respect the Hate List
      - ‘Tier 2’ AI - For boss monsters and raid encounters. Mobs will be extra annoying. They will switch targets. They will stun your healer. They will root your tank and move away.
      - ‘Tier 3’ AI - For end game boss mob adds and PVP style encounters. They will mez you. They will strip your buffs. They will kite your melee DPS. They will ignore the hate list and burst your healers down. You will be upset, and they will be difficult to bear
   - How do I beat X monster or Y encounter?
      - Keep trying. Try different approaches, and think about it like you were PVPing against a real person!
- Mob, Player, Group, and Raid Scaling in 3.0
- Built in MQ2 features for QOL
   - Map shows NPC’s location in real time!
      - Having Tracking skills on your spell bar allows you to see the names of the NPCs on your map. Higher levels of track (and stacked multiple levels of Track) allow you to see NPC names father from your location
   - Advanced Item Info view when inspecting items. Very nice QOL addition. Shows vendor values!
   - Others?
- Custom UI elements (DPS, Synergy info, ect)
   - Built in DPS meter - Shows DPS in and out using server data and should be accurate!
   - Per-Spell Synergy bonus should be visible on the individual spell gem
- Pets and Charm
   - Pets
      - You can have as many pets as you can summon (one per spell gem basically)
      - Pets scale to you. Simply put, pets have a set of stats that is based on the original spell, and then this stat distribution scales up to match your current AA level.
         - Example using inaccurate numbers to clarify how this works: 
            - Your level 1 Magician Air Pet starts with 5 STR, 2 DEX, 10 AGI, 2 STA, 5 INT, 1 WIS, and 5 CHA. This is a total of 30 Stat points
            - You have 600 AA points
            - Your pet scales to your 600 AA point total, which is 20 times the Pets base stats, and each stat then scales that amount.
            - Post scaling, your pets stats would be: 100 STR, 40 DEX, 200 AGI, 40 STA, 100 INT, 20 WIS, and 100 CHA for a total of 600 Stat points
      - Each additional pet you summon after the first reduces the overall damage of each pet you have. This means that 2 pets individually do less damage than 1 pet. 
         - This mechanic has not been fully determined or tested in 3.0, but in 2.5 the sweet spot for maximum pet DPS was between 2 and 3 pets per character.
      - All pets are controllable via the pet window
      - Pet specific buffs apply to all your current pets, but general buffs need to be applied to each pet.
   - Charm
      - Charm spells in Classless simply make a copy of the charmed NPC as your pet. The pet then follows all normal pet rules and scaling
      - Charming a monster does not cause the monster to aggro you
- Specific Skills and how they work
   - Track
   - Double Attack
   - Stealth
   - Probably a lot more
- The World, NPCs, Available Zones, and Quests
   - TAKP DB, ROF2 Client = Unique setup
   - No solid list of info is currently available, though any TAKP data should be accurate
   - We need lots of testing, data collect, recording and assistance building the wiki!
   - P99 ‘Spell List / Class Spell Level‘ should be accurate
- What’s changed from previous Classless server versions?
   - A lot. Like, almost everything. See above document!
   - More choices!
      - You can play as a Class now if you want
      - Weapon ratios matter again
      - Synergy bonuses for each spell, allowing up to 100% increased damage or healing
      - Normalized Augment slots - Everything has one now
      - Natural stats on items multiply the effectiveness of matching Augments!
      - All offensive abilities use Endurance now, and Healing uses Mana
      - Way more spells are important, and tons of builds are viable
      - Armor tiers have new effects (Cloth / Leather / Chain)
   - Harder stuff!
      - Edge server style NPC AI makes all content challenging
      - Better and more stable encounter design

      - Content designed for 6-man groups
      - EXP reworked to incentivize harder content
   - Individual Progression - no more AFK groups or letting a ringer carry
