# Synergy
Synergy causes spells to do bonuses based on how many of the same category are on your spell bar. In the auto equip area of inventory you can see the % of synergy if [Classless](#Classless). If [Classed](#Classed), you are always maximum synergy.
   
# Corpse Instancing
Whenever a monster dies, a unique instance of the corpse is created for your player. This instance is account wide, meaning you can log off and log in an alt to loot.
# Autoloot
When a monster drops a stackable item that you already have inside a bag, you will not need to loot it. The item will be automatically looted and placed on the stack.
- Additional specialized autoloot bags (such as Tradeskill) can be crafted/purchased later.

# Augments
- Classless removed all normal augments from the game, and made every item have a single augment slot.
- All NPCs drop a small category of possible augments, essentially the primary stats, ATK, and AC augs.
- Once an augment is inside gear you have worn, if a greater aug of the same type drops, it will automatically replace the worn augment slot with the superior one.
- The [AA](#AA) Distill Augment will destroy an item to let you salvage the augment.
- Inspecting an item and right clicking an augment to select Destroy will let you do the opposite of Distill Augment, destroying the augment from the item.
- All Augments are NO TRADE.

# Gear
- Wearing a shield causes a 30% damage reduction bonus to all outgoing and incoming damage
- Wearing full plate is an additional 20% damage reduction to all outgoing and incoming damage
- Leather and Chain and mixing gear will calculate the damage reduction the closer it is to plate
- Wearing full cloth has to no damage reduction bonus
- Power source and Charm slot do things I'm not aware of yet.
- Arrows are not consumed (Ranged attack is buggy)
